# Welcome to Giovanni's GitHub Repository

## Introduction
Hello there! I'm Giovanni, a mechanical engineering student at the University of Central Florida. This GitHub repository 
serves as a storage space for my coursework projects and showcases my programming journey as I develop my skills in engineering and programming.

## Background and Skills
While my primary focus is mechanical engineering, I am enthusiastic about expanding my programming skills to enhance
my engineering projects. Currently, I have experience in C programming from coursework and have recently transitioned 
to Python, which aligns better with my engineering goals.

## Coursework Projects
### Rock Paper Scissors Game
- Description: A fun and interactive game where the user can play against the computer in a classic game of rock, paper, scissors.
- Technologies Used: C programming language.

### Restaurant Management System
- Description: A program that simulates a restaurant management system, allowing users to check balances, place food orders, and process returns.
- Technologies Used: C programming language.

### Hangman
- Description: A text-based implementation of the popular game Hangman, where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word.

### Planetary Database
- Description: A program that allows users to manage a database of planets, including adding and removing planets as they are discovered.
- Technologies Used: C programming language.

## Future Plans
I am continuously learning and exploring new technologies and programming concepts to strengthen my engineering skills.
In the near future, I aim to work on personal projects that combine mechanical engineering principles with programming and automation,
which will be showcased in this repository!
